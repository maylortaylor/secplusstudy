Example: 'No critical vulnerabilities older than 30 days.' Think: Appetite is policy, Tolerance is enforcement threshold. Risk Threshold is specific point triggering action. Know that these guide risk response decisions - risks within tolerance may be accepted, beyond tolerance must be addressed. Questions test distinguishing between appetite and tolerance, or identifying which stakeholder sets each (board sets appetite, management sets tolerance)."
